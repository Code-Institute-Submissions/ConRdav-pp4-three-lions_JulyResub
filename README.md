# Three Lions
## About
Three Lions main goal is to give the user a platform to discuss the England National Football team and their chances at the World Cup in 2022.

When users choose to create a post, they are able to give it a title of their choosing (as long as it hasn't already been used by previously), a text box to enter their content of the post and an excerpt text box to draw in potential viewers.

Once the post has been corrected it will be sent for approval by the admin so as to prevent any unsuitable posts. Once the posts have been approved the user will be able to see them on the main post list page. Whilst the post is awaiting approval the user will be made aware by a message in their personal post page.

Other features the user can utilise is editing previous posts and deleting them alltogether within their personal posts page. This enables the user to manage their content as they see fit.

Gym Buddy is a Django framework app. The user's workout data is stored in a database with PostgreSql and the app is hosted on Heroku.

## Project Planning Phase

The main goal for this project was to create a simple, user-friendly application that allows the user to:

1. Create their own blog posts

2. Manage their own content with the option to edit and delete

3. View a list of posts from other users and have the ability to like and comment on those posts.

# User Stories + Acceptance Criteria

These three project goals informed the user story and acceptance criteria that guided the development of the project, as detailed below:

A1) As a user, I want clear instructions on how to navigate and use the app so that it is easy to use.

A2) As a user, I want to be able to view a pre-defined workout routine based on the number of workouts I wish to complete each week.

A3) As a user, I want to be able to create my own workout and save this workout for future reference.

A4) As a user, I want to be able to both view and clear any saved workouts as I wish.
