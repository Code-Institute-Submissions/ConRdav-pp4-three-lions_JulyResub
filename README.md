# Three Lions
## About
Three Lions main goal is to give the user a platform to discuss the England National Football team and their chances at the World Cup in 2022.

When users choose to create a post, they are able to give it a title of their choosing (as long as it hasn't already been used by previously), a text box to enter their content of the post and an excerpt text box to draw in potential viewers.

Once the post has been corrected it will be sent for approval by the admin so as to prevent any unsuitable posts. Once the posts have been approved the user will be able to see them on the main post list page. Whilst the post is awaiting approval the user will be made aware by a message in their personal post page.

Other features the user can utilise is editing previous posts and deleting them alltogether within their personal posts page. This enables the user to manage their content as they see fit.

Three Lions is a Django framework app. The user's post data is stored in a database with PostgreSql and the app is hosted on Heroku.

## Project Planning

The main goal for this project was to create a simple, user-friendly application that allows the user to:

1. Create their own blog posts

2. Manage their own content with the option to edit and delete

3. View a list of posts from other users and have the ability to like and comment on those posts.

The user stories for this project can be viewed [here](https://github.com/ConRdav/pp4-three-lions/projects/1)

## Project Management
I used GitHub's KanBan board to manage my workflow. [Three Lions Workflow](https://github.com/ConRdav/pp4-three-lions/projects/2)

## Features

### Welcome to Three Lions
Upon opening the app users are met with a page full of blog posts which even without an account they can view.

The navbar for users without an account will have a sign up option allowing them to create their own account.

### Create A Blog Post
Once a user has their account set up they are then given more options on the navbar including 'create a post' and 'My posts'.

### View Your Own Posts
When a user clicks on my posts they will have a similar screen as the home page but with only their posts on it and it will show if they have been approved by admin or if its pending.

### Delete Your Post
Users will need to confirm they wish to delete their post.
